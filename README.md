# Arduino-Quadcopter
## About
- This repository contains a project which I've worked on during my first attempt at using Arduino boards during sophomore year of highschool.
- Used components such as bluetooth and radio transmitters, transistors, motors, and controllers in order to create a simple Quadcopter.
- As summer ended and school started, the project was not continued.
- A copy of the code found on my system was then published to GitHub
## Plans
- Review the usability of the code.
- Potentially continue the project in the future with the newly learned knowledge in the past years.
## Status
- Old project
